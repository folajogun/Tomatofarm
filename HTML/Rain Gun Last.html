	<h1>How long does Rain Gun last?</h1>
	<p>A rain gun can last for 1 â€“ 15 years. The longevity of a rain gun depends on a lot of factors. For instance, the type of material used for the production of the rain gun can affect how long it will last. Alloy rain gun usually lasts longer than plastic rain guns.</p>
	<p>The quality of water used for the rain gun irrigation system and the type of filters used can also impact the longevity of a rain gun. Water with a lot of impurities and high iron content can block the emitters of the rain gun and make it unusable.</p>
