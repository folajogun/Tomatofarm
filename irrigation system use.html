	<h1>How much water does the rain gun irrigation system use?</h1>
	<p>The volume of water needed for a rain gun irrigation system is usually higher than that of a drip irrigation system. A rain gun can use 25,000 – 80,000 litres of water in one hour. Rain guns are notorious for using a huge volume of water.</p>
	<p>The volume of water needed for a rain gun irrigation system can be affected by a lot of factors. The type of rain gun used can matter. Small rain guns do not use as much water like big rain guns.</p>
	<p>Generally, a typical rain gun irrigation system uses 25,000 – 80,000 litres of water per hour.</p>
	<h1>Factors that affect the volume of water needed for a rain gun irrigation system</h1>
	<p>The following factors affect the volume of water needed for a rain gun irrigation system:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Climatic Condition</li>
		<li>Age of Plant</li>
		<li>Type of Crop</li>
		<li>Wind Speed</li>
		<li>Type of Soil</li>
		<li>Type of nozzle used</li>
	</ol>
	<p><strong>1) Climatic Condition</strong></p>
	<p>The rain gun irrigation system will typically use more water in a hot tropical environment. In colder climes, plants do not need a lot of water; hence, the rain gun irrigation system may also not need a lot of water.</p>
	<p>Rain guns in hot countries like Nigeria will need more water than rain guns in cold countries like Norway.</p>
	<p><strong>2) Age of Plant</strong></p>
	<p>If you rain guns are used to irrigate young plants like seedlings, you may not need to feed them with a lot of water. However, if the rain guns are used to spray droplets of water to matured plants, you will need a lot of water.</p>
	<p><strong>3) Type of Crop</strong></p>
	<p>Rain gun irrigation system used for irrigating tree crops like cocoa, oil palm, cashew and mango will need a huge volume of water while rain guns used to irrigate vegetable crops like pepper, tomato and cucumber will need significantly lesser volume of water.</p>
	<p><strong>4) Wind Speed</strong></p>
	<p>In locations where the wind speed is high, rain gun irrigation systems usually needs more water because the high speed of the wind increases water usage in plants.</p>
	<p><strong>5) Type of Soil</strong></p>
	<p>Rain gun irrigation system used in places with sandy soil will need to spray more water to the plants as the loose nature of the soil will drain away a lot of water unlike loamy and clay soil.</p>
	<p><strong>6) Type of Nozzle Used</strong></p>
	<p>Rain guns with high discharge nozzles use significantly more water than rain guns with low discharge nozzles.</p>
